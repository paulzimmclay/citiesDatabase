Create an application that displays 10 cities you have visited from a database (stored in local storage)

Details for each city

  a. City name
  b. Year you visited
  c. Image of city
  d. List of top 5 attractions

Display your trips on the Dom, styled in cards. City name should appear above the image, in a larger font size, with all other details below the image

Filter the cards based on specific year visited, or all cities

Style each card with a different background color, colored by continent (North America = green, South America = blue, Asia = purple, Antarctica = yellow, Europe = orange, Africa = red, Australia = brown)
